Title: Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets 
Author: Elana J. Fertig
Description: Coordinated Gene Activity in Pattern Sets (CoGAPS) infers
  biological processes which are active in individual gene sets from
  corresponding microarray measurements.  CoGAPS achieves this inference by
  combining a MCMC matrix decomposition algorithm (GAPS) with a novel statistic
  inferring activity on gene sets.
